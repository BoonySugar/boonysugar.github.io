			<h1 class="heading">Who We Are</h1>
			<p class="text">Aether is managed by Ben Shpetner and Bruno Zero from Brooklyn, New York. Collectively, we are two young adults who love photography, fashion, and New York City. We both went into middle school as complete strangers but we developed a strong friendship over our shared love of hip hop, fashion, and artistic pursuits like photography. As we slowly got into photography after being inspired by the various urban explorers in NYC, we've become incredibly interested in this genre of photography and we hope that you'll be just as captivated as we are. NYC is full of incredible and breathtaking high views, as well as many forgotten and abandoned places. We want to capture them all. This website serves as a showcase of some of our work as well as a place for us to try our hand at prefessional web design. If you like this site, please let us know! Managing Aether, we strive to put out the best photos for the public to enjoy. In order to navigate this site, use the links on the navigation bar up top, or simply scroll. The section you are currently reading should be underlined on the navbar. (This site is designed/built/maintained by Ben Shpetner)

			<h1 class="heading">What We Do</h1>
			<p class="text">
			Aether started as just a couple of young guys with photography fantasies, ranging from capturing the most vertigo-inducing moments, to exploring the most forbidding buildings in all of New York City. From the day we created Aether, it has been evolving. Eager to convert our fantasies into reality, we started to visit inspiring locations in both Brooklyn and Manhattan to take photos. We've gained experience in urban exploration over a series of years from photography sessions filled with trial and error. Today, we both still have the same passion for urban exploring and photography, and we try to partake in a routine of shooting and posting frequently.
